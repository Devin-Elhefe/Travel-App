__**My Travel App**__

I love to travel and sometimes lose track of the places I have been. So what better way to do so then creating a travel app. Not only can users keep track of where they have been,
they can also write a descprition and include a picture. 

**Some app features:**

A user will be able to create an account, log in, and manage a list of travel destinations.
The user can add trips to two categories: “My Trips” (places they have already been) and “Wishlist” (places they want to go).
For places they have visited, they can enter details about their visit, such as the date and notes, and they will also be able to add pictures.
Any places they have not been able to visit yet, they will place in the “Wishlist”.

**App link:** https://my-travelapp-bdae65365ae3.herokuapp.com/





**Technologies Used:** Javascript/CSS/EJS/Session-based authentication

**Next Steps:**

1) Create a button for the Wishlist items. Once the button is clicked it moves to the My Trips section.
2) Add a link so you can share your trips on Social Media.
